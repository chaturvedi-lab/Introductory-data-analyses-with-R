This is introductory course to do data analyses using the programming language R. We will use R Studio Cloud to get aquainted with the R programming language and perform some basic data analyses with some dummy data. We will then use specific data to do statistical tests and visualize patterns in R.

1. What is R?

* R is a ‘programming environment for statistics and graphics’

* The base R has fewer prepackaged statistics procedure than SPSS or SAS, but it is much easier to extend with new procedures.

* There are over 6000 published extension packages for R, many aimed at genetics and genomics research.

2. Using R
R is a free implemention of S, for which John Chambers won the
ACM Software Systems award.
For the S system, which has forever altered how people
analyze, visualize, and manipulate data.
The downside is that using R effectively may require changing
how you analyze, visualize, and manipulate data.
R is a command-line system, not a point-and-click system.
